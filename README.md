These are the series of instructions meant to show how to turn Ubuntu into a Powerful and Stable Web Development Machine from scratch.

I am going to start installing VIM editor essential for many tasks, and continue with GIT version tracking and other essential technologies and environments for Web Development.

## Installation instructions
